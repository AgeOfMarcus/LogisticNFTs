# LogisticNFTs

These are a collection of handpicked images generated by the results of the logistic map function at `r=3.57`. This is intended to pay respect to one of the first ways we generated psuedo-random numbers.

All code used to generate these images can be found [on replit](https://replit.com/@MarcusWeinberger/nft-generator)
